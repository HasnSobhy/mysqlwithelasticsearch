# Connect MySQL With Elasticsearch
A small library to connect MySQL with Elasticsearch to sync data and do full text search. Working example can be found on my article [How To Setup Elasticsearch With MySQL](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/setup-elasticsearch-with-mysql/)

Clone the library and run `composer install` to install the required dependencies. 

Once the dependencies is install set **sql query**, **mapping** for elasticsearch and **params** structure and then start using class.

Feel free to fork the libray and to make it more easy for the users.
